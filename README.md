# System control of mobile robotic platform based on fuzzy logic
There are two parts: coursework and practice
I build this platform for my coursework with autonomus movement
After that, within the practice, I made GUI using C# and UDP-protocol for client-server model control (laptop and raspberry pi with usb-webcam )
